Title: Loops and conditional statements

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: In Programming, sometimes there is a need to perform some operation more than once or (say) n number of times. Loops come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements. 
There are mainly two types of loops:  
Entry Controlled loops: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.
Exit Controlled Loops: In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once,
irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

The conditional statements (also known as decision control structures) such as if, if else, switch, etc. are used for decision-making purposes in C/C++ programs.


Algorithm:

Start => declare an integer and take its input from user => using for, while and do while loops print the tables of the input given by the user =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:
We declare an integer and take its input from user, then using for, while and do while loops we print the tables of the input given by the user.
